### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is On and I'm an aspiring web developer mainly focused on the back-end, but I also love using React. 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a multiplayer tic-tac-toe web application, implemented with Express, React, SocketIO and more!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go, through building an interpeter with an awesome book I've found: "Writing An Interpreter In Go" by Thorsten Ball.
- âš¡ I'm currently learning computer science in Bar-Ilan university, starting my second year soon.
